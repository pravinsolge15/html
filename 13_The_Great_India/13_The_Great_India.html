<div id="Before & After">
    <h2>India Before And After</h2>
    <p>With the decision by Britain to withdraw from the Indian subcontinent, the Congress Party and Muslim League agreed in June 1947 to a partition of India along religious lines. Under the provisions of the Indian Independence Act, India and Pakistan were established as independent dominions with predominantly Hindu areas allocated to India and predominantly Muslim areas to Pakistan.</p>
    <p> After India's independence on August 15, 1947, India received most of the subcontinent's 562 widely scattered polities, or princely states, as well as the majority of the British provinces, and parts of three of the remaining provinces. Muslim Pakistan received the remainder. Pakistan consisted of a western wing, with the approximate boundaries of modern Pakistan, and an eastern wing, with the boundaries of present-day Bangladesh.</p>
    <p> The division of the subcontinent caused tremendous dislocation of populations; inter-communal violence cost more than 1,000,000 lives. Some 3.5 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from Pakistan into India, andabout 5 million Muslims migrated from India to Pakistan. In Punjab, where the Sikh community was cut in half, a period of terrible bloodshed followed. Overall, the demographic shift caused an initial bitterness between the two countries that was further intensified by each country's accession of a portion of the princely states.</p>

    <h2>Indian Freedom Fighters</h2>
    <p>Freedom fighters were those great personalities who consecrated
        their lives for the cause of attainment of freedom from the colonization of the
        British. They made many sacrifices; we cannot just imagine the amount of pain,
        hardships, risks, and opposition they must have gone through or faced in
        rallying the Indians against the Britishers. How wonderfully versatile and
        talented they were! Mahatma Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh, Udham
        Sigh, Chander Shekhar, Rajguru, Sukhdev, Mangal Pandey, Rani Laxmi Bai, and
        many more who sacrificed their everything for the motherland. Subhash Chandra
        Bose  went from all the way from India to
        Germany by road! He took Hitler's help in raising Indian National Army! How
        brave and innovative achiever he must have been! He attacked the Britishers
        from Burma; he captured Andaman an Nicobar islands from the Britishers.

        The freedom and convenient life we enjoy in the present, we
        owe it to our freedom fighters. Let’s salute them!
